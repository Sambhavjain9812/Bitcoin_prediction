DESCRIPTION

This is a regression problem where we need to predict the price of Bitcoin. We use Linear, Lasso Regression and Decision tree Regressor

WHAT I HAD DONE

perfromed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset
it starts with loading the dataset and viewing the top 5 rows
we calculate statistical data in the dataset
then comes finding correlation between the features and also finding statistical values related to the dataset
data visualization is done with libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn
finally 3 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm
also accuracy score of each algorithm is calculated for comparison purpose with other algorithms
MODELS USED

Linear Regression= simplest and most common algorithm used for classification problems
Support Vector Regressor
Random forest Regressor

LIBRARIES NEEDED

Numpy 
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-Learn

ACCURACIES

Linear Regression Score = 0.9999539378804362 

Random forest Regression Score = 0.9996591600661323

Support Vector Regressor Score = 0.13660060536688778

CONCLUSION

We can conclude that Linear Regression gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement.
